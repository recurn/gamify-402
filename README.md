# Healthier Cyborgs: Gamified
 
 Hello, and welcome to my code!
 
 If you are wanting to see the code that I wrote these are the areas you will want to look at the following areas:
 
public/  
  index.html -> this is where the main html is and where all the content is ultimately being rendered  
  js/  
    app.js -> The javascript controlling the main content and how it is updated. Also contains the vue component.  
    auth.js -> Handles user log in/out  
    processing.js -> where the users values are being rendered (xp, level, streaks, ect...)  
    rescueTimeDisplay.js -> Rendering the graph for all the RescueTime data 
  css/ 
    styles.css -> all of the things that make the final product look pretty
    
functions/  
  index.js -> All of the firebase cloud functions. Handles all the server-side code
